		<h1> Joshua Robert White </h1>
		<p>	My name is Joshua Robert White. I am currently in a rehab facility for homeless and
		addicted men. I moved here to go to college, but it seems that I matured late. I got involved
		with drugs and alcohol, which eventually brought me to where I am now. I am trying to find myself
		again. I was always interested in technology, and am hoping to leverage this opportunity to do
		something for myself that I should have done a long time ago. </p>
		<p>Some of my favorite foods include:
			<ul>
				<li>Tacos</li>
				<li>Stir Fry</li>
				<li>Curry</li>
			</ul>
		Some of my hobbies include:
			<ul>
				<li>Listening to music</li>
				<li>Running</li>
				<li>Reading</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
